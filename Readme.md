BusStop Finder App
==================

to build: node, bower and grunt must be already installed, bower download all the external dependencies (libs) like backbone, jquery... in order to keep the repo as clean as can posible.
  grunt executes different taks like could be: generate Jade files, evaluate Js code using JsHint, concat files, uglifiyng usinig requireJs and clean directories.

  Commands to run:
    - bower install
    - grunt
    - node app.js

I choose Backbone, because its the better way to keep all code clean and comprehensive.
